This is a sample Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) project created to explain the working and architecture of a RAG system.
A sample PDF is connected to the system. The document is processed, converted into embeddings, and stored in a vector database. When a question is asked, the system retrieves only the relevant content from the PDF and generates an answer using a local LLM.
The key idea of this project is to ensure that the model responds strictly based on the provided document, not from its general knowledge.
This project is intended for learning and demonstration purposes and serves as a foundation for building more advanced RAG-based applications.
